# lab-07
## Description
You know a lot of information from previous labs, so now you can shine and show yourself. 
You can use some data from [free API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) - and use it to fill your DB.


## Tasks
1. Create `npm project`
1. Add `express`, `sequelize`, and other packages what you need
1. Create [migration](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html) for database
1. ORM scheme (2 models connected via [association](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/associations/base.js~Association.html))
1. Create 4 endpoints
    1. get all information via one request (from both tables) 
    1. get information about one specific item from table
    1. post new item into table
    1. delete item from table
1. **Bonus:** Create tests for endpoints with packages `jest`, `supertest`

## Some tips
1. Migration should create DB from nothing. Learn how to do it.
1. Do tasks steps by step. Focus on one thing.
1. Use `documentation`, `google`, `stackoverflow`
1. Comment your code!
1. Format your code! Don't be a messy programmer.
